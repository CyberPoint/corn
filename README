C-CoRN, the Coq Constructive Repository at Nijmegen
---------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES
-------------

This version of C-CoRN is known to compile with:

 - Coq 8.4pl4

 - SCons 1.2 or make

GIT CHECKOUT & SUBMODULES
-------------------------

C-CoRN depends on Math Classes, which is a library of abstract interfaces for 
mathematical structures that is heavily based on Coq's new type classes. 

MathClasses can be installed using OPAM.

Or directly using from git:

BUILDING C-CoRN
---------------

C-CoRN uses SCons for its build infrastructure. SCons is a modern
Python-based Make-replacement.

To build C-CoRN with SCons say "scons" to build the whole library, or 
"scons some/module.vo" to just build some/module.vo (and its dependencies).

In addition to common Make options like -j N and -k, SCons
supports some useful options of its own, such as --debug=time, which
displays the time spent executing individual build commands.

scons -c replaces Make clean

For more information, see the SCons documentation at

  http://www.scons.org/


Make is still supported.


BUILDING DOCUMENTATION
----------------------

To build CoqDoc documentation, say "scons coqdoc".
